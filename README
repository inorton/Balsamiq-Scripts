Balsamiq Mockups Scripts
--------------------------

This is a (very) small collection (1) of scripts to handle batch
operations (eg, png export) from Balsamiq Mockups when running
on linux (and perhaps MacOSX).

Current Scripts:

batch-png-export.pl - inb@ncipher.com
 Export All Mockups to PNG files, ideal for a cron job
 Requires:-
 + vncserver
 + perl
 + bmml.py (optional for html generation - http://vi.to/bmml/)
   bmml.py does not support the "symbols" feature and is no 
   longer supported by it's authors.
